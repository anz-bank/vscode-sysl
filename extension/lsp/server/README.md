# LSP Plugin Template

An LSP server toolkit that provides a solid foundation for Sysl plugins.

- Interpretation of experimental `ClientCapabilities`
- Fetching Sysl extension settings
- Management of text document state, including corresponding Sysl protobuf model
- Simple callbacks for standard operations (e.g. transform Sysl model to diagram)
- Callbacks to handle Sysl-specific notifications
